Hey there! It's great to have you here! A little backstory to why I decided to start this blog: 
At my last company, we were encouraged to write a lot but somehow I couldn't consistently get over my 4 year writing block so I ended up writing 2 technical docs. This is bad, considering I solved some interesting problems. So this blog is meant to help me tackle this bad habit. It's also to help me get comfortable documenting the problems I encounter, the interesting ways I come up with to solve these problems, and every other thing I learn that I think would be worth my readers' while. 

I would appreciate it a lot if readers reach out with comments in response to things said in future articles, positive and not too negative feedback on writing style, et cetera. 
Thank you for reading! See you when the next post drops ;)

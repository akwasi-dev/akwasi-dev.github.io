A little life update: I will be spending the next 12 weeks at the[ Recurse Center (RC)](https://www.recurse.com/). Remotely. 
I heard about RC from a friend (creator of [Playlistor](https://playlistor.io/)) in 2019, and I've finally been given the privilege of time to apply and (fortunately) join a 12-week batch. 

RC is a retreat where curious programmers recharge and grow. Honestly if you want to get better at programming, then RC is for you. RC offers something that working or learning alone will never offer, i.e a supportive community of motivated peers who are dedicated to lifelong learning. It is self-directed, meaning you pick and choose what you spend your time working on and the people you want to work with, without looming deadlines or OKRs. I can't possibly describe all that RC is about in this blog post so I recommend that you read the [FAQ](https://www.recurse.com/faq) and [The RC User's manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual) if what I've described piques your interest. Notably RC is open to everyone, including people who are looking to switch careers into tech so don't hesitate to apply if that applies to you. Learn more [here](https://www.recurse.com/paths)

Interestingly, my current goals for RC differ significantly from what I initially outlined in my application form. After much reflection, I realized my initial TODO list was not meeting the "work at the edge of your abilities" criteria for me so I had to switch things up. That said, here is a little glimpse into how I now intend to spend my time at RC: 
1. Improve my knowledge of Rust
2. Build a couple of emulators
3. Build trivial tools to solve the little problems I face
4. Socialize and pair program with a lot of people, especially during my first 2 weeks. There are too many cool people in my batch for me to not do this
5. Finish the [Programming Rust:  Fast, Safe Systems Development book ](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)(currently 50% through)
6. Start and finish [Rust for Rustaceans](https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/). 
7. Work on projects I haven't yet conceptualized
8. Have lots of fun

Some items on this list are non-negotiable, and will get done by the end of my batch. I'm fully aware that life will happen and not everything on this short list will be completed and I have no problem with that. I will share a progress update when I'm midway through the batch.

Welcome to **myspace**. I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Here is where I will share my projects, musings, problems I encounter (and how I solve them), even if no one is looking, reading or caring. 

## Why? 
I'm in the arena trying stuff. Some will work, some won't; I want to be documenting everything. 
Seriously though, I don't write enough and this is an effort to change that. 

*PS: Thank you Chamath for that classic quote*

## Posting Schedule? 
Although I have some time on my hands now, I do not want to commit to a posting schedule for this blog. Instead, I'll be sharing posts as soon as drafts are completed, which I hope would happen quite frequently ;).

## Conclusion? 
If you do care enough to read the posts on this blog, I will appreciate it a whole lot if you could spend some extra time to opine and share feedback on writing style, typos and bad grammar. 

So long. 

â€” Isaac.
